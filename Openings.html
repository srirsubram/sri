<p>I am always looking for talented and motivated students to join my team as
a PhD student. </p>


<p >One of my interests is in exploring the design, implementation and evaluation
of acoustic metamaterials. The aim is to use advances in acoustic metamaterials
to create novel interactive applications by dynamically manipulating sound
waves. </p>


<p>I have funding for PhD students to join my team to explore three key
objectives. </p>


<p ><b> 1)	Design, implement and evaluate metamaterials: </b>The main objective is to examine different structures of metamaterials
brick for transmissive, reflective and combined conditions. The objective here
is to understand and design unit cells that perform well in different geometric
manipulations. </p>


<p ><b> 2) Computational control of a <span
class=SpellE>metasurface</span>: </b> The objective here is to develop computational control algorithms to
allow effective reconfiguration of a <span class=SpellE>metasurface</span>. We
will test a variety of approaches to assembling and controlling the <span
class=SpellE>metasurface</span> to verify the effectiveness of our strategies. </p>



<p ><b> 3) Build interactive prototypes: </b> The final objective
is to create interactive prototypes that allow us to critically examine the
suitability of metamaterials for building interactive sound manipulation
applications. We will construct interactive prototypes that incorporate
user-input into <span class=SpellE>metasurface</span> control to create a
feedback loop. 


<p >Our multidisciplinary approach helps shed new light on scientific
principles as well as enable creation of untapped interactive experiences and
the exploration of their effects on users. This approach allows us to
contribute to a broad range of fields through publications in specialised as
well as more trans-disciplinary venues. In addition to publishing our work we
actively explore public engagement and impact realisation.</p>


<p >If you are interested in the above topic, I encourage you to contact me
with a statement of purpose. Please note that you will still need
to submit an application to UCL (<a
href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/how-apply-step-step-guide">relevant
UCL pages</a>). In your applications, you need to identify the advisers
that you may be interested in, as that also helps ensure that your application
is considered by the appropriate people.</p>
